## `getSearchConsolePages()`

```php
getSearchConsolePages($project_id, $range, $from, $to, $sort, $page, $per_page, $output, $search_type, $filters, $data_state)
```

Top Search Console pages (Growth+)

Top Google Search Console landing pages over a date range, ranked by impressions, clicks, ctr or position, paginated. Requires a connected Search Console property (Growth+). X-Search-Console-Backend identifies stored or live reads. Stored reads use synced data without contacting Google. Live reads return ERR_SEARCH_CONSOLE_ACCESS_REVOKED (403) for revoked Google access; reconnect the property in Preferences > Project Settings > Data Connections. They return ERR_SEARCH_CONSOLE_UPSTREAM (503) when Google Search Console is unavailable or over quota; wait for the number of seconds in Retry-After before retrying. total counts distinct keys available for the range: keys from synced daily rows for stored reads, or up to 25,000 rows from one Google request for live reads. Live responses include truncated: true when that limit is reached. Sorting and pagination apply to the available set.

### Example

```php
<?php
require_once(__DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php');


// Configure Bearer authorization: BearerAuth
$config = LLMPulse\Configuration::getDefaultConfiguration()->setAccessToken('YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN');


$apiInstance = new LLMPulse\Api\SearchConsoleApi(
    // If you want use custom http client, pass your client which implements `GuzzleHttp\ClientInterface`.
    // This is optional, `GuzzleHttp\Client` will be used as default.
    new GuzzleHttp\Client(),
    $config
);
$project_id = 56; // int | Project ID
$range = 56; // int | Number of days to look back (alternative to from/to)
$from = new \DateTime('2013-10-20T19:20:30+01:00'); // \DateTime
$to = new \DateTime('2013-10-20T19:20:30+01:00'); // \DateTime | End of the window. A date-only value such as 2026-09-01 covers that whole day. Pass a full timestamp to end the window earlier.
$sort = 'impressions'; // string
$page = 1; // int
$per_page = 20; // int
$output = 'output_example'; // string | Rectangular output for BI tools (Tableau, Excel, Sheets, ELT). Omit for the default nested JSON. 'flat' returns the same metadata plus 'columns' and 'rows'; 'csv' returns those rows as text/csv. Errors are always returned as JSON.
$search_type = 'web'; // string | Which search surface to measure. Defaults to web. discover and googleNews carry no query dimension, so Google rejects /search_console/queries for them.
$filters = [{"dimension":"page","operator":"contains","expression":"/blog/"}]; // string | Narrow the query; every entry must match (AND). Send the whole list as one JSON value: filters=[{\"dimension\":\"page\",\"operator\":\"contains\",\"expression\":\"/blog/\"}] (URL-encoded). An array of objects has no query-parameter form a generated client can produce, so the string is what the official SDKs send; see the SearchConsoleFilters schema for the shape it encodes. includingRegex and excludingRegex take RE2 syntax. At most 10 entries, expression at most 500 characters. The bracket form filters[][dimension]=page&filters[][operator]=contains&filters[][expression]=/blog/ is also accepted.
$data_state = 'final'; // string | final (default) counts only rows Google has finalized. all also counts the most recent days, which are still being filled in and will change.

try {
    $apiInstance->getSearchConsolePages($project_id, $range, $from, $to, $sort, $page, $per_page, $output, $search_type, $filters, $data_state);
} catch (Exception $e) {
    echo 'Exception when calling SearchConsoleApi->getSearchConsolePages: ', $e->getMessage(), PHP_EOL;

## `getSearchConsoleSummary()`

```php
getSearchConsoleSummary($project_id, $range, $from, $to, $dimension, $limit, $search_type, $filters, $data_state)
```

Search Console summary (Growth+)

Google Search Console headline totals (impressions, clicks, ctr as a 0..1 fraction, average position) for the project over a date range. Pass dimension=country, device, page, query or searchAppearance to also receive the breakdown aggregated over the range, capped by limit. Requires the project to have a connected Search Console property and the Growth plan or above; otherwise returns ERR_SEARCH_CONSOLE_NOT_CONNECTED or ERR_PLAN_REQUIRED. X-Search-Console-Backend identifies stored or live reads. Stored reads use synced data without contacting Google. Live reads return ERR_SEARCH_CONSOLE_ACCESS_REVOKED (403) for revoked Google access; reconnect the property in Preferences > Project Settings > Data Connections. They return ERR_SEARCH_CONSOLE_UPSTREAM (503) when Google Search Console is unavailable or over quota; wait for the number of seconds in Retry-After before retrying.

## `getSearchConsoleTimeseries()`

```php
getSearchConsoleTimeseries($project_id, $range, $from, $to, $granularity, $output, $search_type, $filters, $data_state)
```

Search Console time series (Growth+)

Google Search Console property-wide series (impressions, clicks, ctr, position) bucketed by day, week or month. Requires a connected Search Console property (Growth+). X-Search-Console-Backend identifies stored or live reads. Stored reads use synced data without contacting Google. Live reads return ERR_SEARCH_CONSOLE_ACCESS_REVOKED (403) for revoked Google access; reconnect the property in Preferences > Project Settings > Data Connections. They return ERR_SEARCH_CONSOLE_UPSTREAM (503) when Google Search Console is unavailable or over quota; wait for the number of seconds in Retry-After before retrying.
