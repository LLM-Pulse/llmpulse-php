## `getCitedUrlContent()`

```php
getCitedUrlContent($project_id, $url_sha256)
```

Cited URL cached content

Unavailable page content keeps the cited URL and citation metrics. Page metadata/content and unknown brand_mentioned/competitor_mentioned return null. content_gap_status is content_unavailable (or missing_page_cache) without usable content, and mentions_not_processed when the page has usable content but its mention analysis has not completed for this project. Mention fields (brand_mentioned, competitor_mentioned, brand_position, brands, mentions, content_gap_status) describe the analysis for the requesting project: a page not yet analyzed for it returns null (never false) brand_mentioned, competitor_mentioned and brand_position, empty brands and mentions arrays and page_cache.mentions_processed false. page_cache.mentions_processed is true exactly when brand_mentioned is not null. An analyzed page keeps its last result until a newer analysis replaces it. status_code shows a saved successful response or observed 404/410; other crawl failures and error_message are hidden. last_crawled_at dates the saved copy. Domain/host crawled_urls_count counts usable copies; brand_mentioned_urls_count and competitor_mentioned_urls_count count only URLs analyzed for the project and are null when none is.

### Example

```php
<?php
require_once(__DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php');


// Configure Bearer authorization: BearerAuth
$config = LLMPulse\Configuration::getDefaultConfiguration()->setAccessToken('YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN');


$apiInstance = new LLMPulse\Api\SourcesCitationIntelligenceApi(
    // If you want use custom http client, pass your client which implements `GuzzleHttp\ClientInterface`.
    // This is optional, `GuzzleHttp\Client` will be used as default.
    new GuzzleHttp\Client(),
    $config
);
$project_id = 56; // int | Project ID
$url_sha256 = 'url_sha256_example'; // string | 64-character hex SHA-256 of the cited URL

try {
    $apiInstance->getCitedUrlContent($project_id, $url_sha256);
} catch (Exception $e) {
    echo 'Exception when calling SourcesCitationIntelligenceApi->getCitedUrlContent: ', $e->getMessage(), PHP_EOL;
}
```

### Parameters

| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| **project_id** | **int**| Project ID | |
| **url_sha256** | **string**| 64-character hex SHA-256 of the cited URL | |

## `getCitedUrlDetail()`

```php
getCitedUrlDetail($project_id, $url_sha256, $model, $collection_id, $country_code, $language_code, $prompt, $brand_kind, $from, $to, $source_type, $sentiment, $content_gap, $include_series)
```

Cited URL detail

Unavailable page content keeps the cited URL and citation metrics. Page metadata/content and unknown brand_mentioned/competitor_mentioned return null. content_gap_status is content_unavailable (or missing_page_cache) without usable content, and mentions_not_processed when the page has usable content but its mention analysis has not completed for this project. Mention fields (brand_mentioned, competitor_mentioned, brand_position, brands, mentions, content_gap_status) describe the analysis for the requesting project: a page not yet analyzed for it returns null (never false) brand_mentioned, competitor_mentioned and brand_position, empty brands and mentions arrays and page_cache.mentions_processed false. page_cache.mentions_processed is true exactly when brand_mentioned is not null. An analyzed page keeps its last result until a newer analysis replaces it. status_code shows a saved successful response or observed 404/410; other crawl failures and error_message are hidden. last_crawled_at dates the saved copy. Domain/host crawled_urls_count counts usable copies; brand_mentioned_urls_count and competitor_mentioned_urls_count count only URLs analyzed for the project and are null when none is. The filters narrow stats and citation_series alike. citation_series (with include_series=true) holds the answers citing the URL under the same filters: granularity (day, week or month, from the account tracking cadence, with weeks when a daily account spans more than 60 days, starting on Monday), total (equal to total_responses), by_model (answers per AI model, largest first, which can include enabled models outside the seven the model filter accepts) and data, one { date, value } point per period that holds a filtered answer, so a zero means answers ran and none cited it. Periods date each answer by its executed_at in Europe/Madrid time, the column from and to filter.

$model = 'model_example'; // string | Filter by one AI model. Only chatgpt, ai_overview, ai_mode, perplexity, gemini, naver_ai, baidu_ai, naver_ai_tab, qwen and doubao are accepted: any other value, including another model enabled for the API key's user, returns 422 ERR_INVALID_PARAM (invalid model). One of those ten that the user has not enabled also returns 422 ERR_INVALID_PARAM, with the valid values in the message.
$collection_id = 12,34; // string | One collection/tag ID or a comma-separated list of IDs. A query value is always a string on the wire, so it is typed as one: the previous integer-or-string union made generators emit a wrapper type they could not serialize.

## `listCitationGroups()`

```

Grouped citation intelligence

Grouped citation intelligence by url / domain / host with per-model breakdown, citation rate, and avg citation position. Counts and citation rate include visible citations and background source references. Average position ignores rows with position=0. Owned and competitor source matching honor the project's exact-subdomain setting. Filter vocabulary aligns with `source_type` returned by the API. Unavailable page content keeps the cited URL and citation metrics. Page metadata/content and unknown brand_mentioned/competitor_mentioned return null. content_gap_status is content_unavailable (or missing_page_cache) without usable content, and mentions_not_processed when the page has usable content but its mention analysis has not completed for this project. Mention fields (brand_mentioned, competitor_mentioned, brand_position, brands, mentions, content_gap_status) describe the analysis for the requesting project: a page not yet analyzed for it returns null (never false) brand_mentioned, competitor_mentioned and brand_position, empty brands and mentions arrays and page_cache.mentions_processed false. page_cache.mentions_processed is true exactly when brand_mentioned is not null. An analyzed page keeps its last result until a newer analysis replaces it. status_code shows a saved successful response or observed 404/410; other crawl failures and error_message are hidden. last_crawled_at dates the saved copy. Domain/host crawled_urls_count counts usable copies; brand_mentioned_urls_count and competitor_mentioned_urls_count count only URLs analyzed for the project and are null when none is. Pass key to read one group; brand_kind filters by the brand focus of the prompts, like the source page. citation_series (with include_series=true) holds the answers citing the URL, domain or host under the same filters: granularity (day, week or month, from the account tracking cadence, with weeks when a daily account spans more than 60 days, starting on Monday), total (equal to total_responses), by_model (answers per AI model, largest first, which can include enabled models outside the seven the model filter accepts) and data, one { date, value } point per period that holds a filtered answer, so a zero means answers ran and none cited it.

## `listSources()`

```php
listSources($project_id, $page, $per_page, $model, $collection_id, $country_code, $language_code, $prompt, $from, $to, $source_type, $mention_filter, $competitors, $output, $prompt_type, $brand_kind, $range)
```

List source URLs

### Example

```php
<?php
require_once(__DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php');


// Configure Bearer authorization: BearerAuth
$config = LLMPulse\Configuration::getDefaultConfiguration()->setAccessToken('YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN');


$apiInstance = new LLMPulse\Api\SourcesCitationIntelligenceApi(
    // If you want use custom http client, pass your client which implements `GuzzleHttp\ClientInterface`.
    // This is optional, `GuzzleHttp\Client` will be used as default.
    new GuzzleHttp\Client(),
    $config
);
$project_id = 56; // int | Project ID
$page = 1; // int
$per_page = 20; // int
$model = 'model_example'; // string | Filter by one AI model. It must be a model enabled for the API key's user: an unknown value, or a model the user has not enabled, returns 422 ERR_INVALID_PARAM with the valid values in the message.
$collection_id = 12,34; // string | One collection/tag ID or a comma-separated list of IDs. A query value is always a string on the wire, so it is typed as one: the previous integer-or-string union made generators emit a wrapper type they could not serialize.
$country_code = 'country_code_example'; // string | One ISO country code or a comma-separated list (e.g. US,GB,DE)
$language_code = 'language_code_example'; // string | One ISO language code or a comma-separated list (e.g. en,es,de)
$prompt = 56; // int | Filter by prompt ID
$from = new \DateTime('2013-10-20T19:20:30+01:00'); // \DateTime
$to = new \DateTime('2013-10-20T19:20:30+01:00'); // \DateTime | End of the window. A date-only value such as 2026-09-01 covers that whole day. Pass a full timestamp to end the window earlier.
$source_type = 'source_type_example'; // string | Filter by source ownership. Owned and competitor matching honor the project's exact-subdomain setting. Any other value, including a differently cased one, returns ERR_INVALID_PARAM.
$mention_filter = 'mention_filter_example'; // string | Filter by which brands are mentioned, as a two-axis matrix (your brand x competitors): mentions_you / not_mentions_you, mentions_competitor / not_mentions_competitor, and the four combined cells you_and_competitor, competitor_not_you (a rival wins and you are absent), you_not_competitor, no_brands (no tracked brand appears, i.e. open space). Combine with 'competitors' to narrow the competitor side to specific rivals; on a negative cell that reads 'none of these'. On /dimensions/sources it applies to the crawled content of each cited page instead of the answer text. The legacy value 'competitors_only' is still accepted as an alias of competitor_not_you.
$competitors = 'competitors_example'; // string | Comma-separated competitor IDs (unknown IDs return ERR_INVALID_PARAM)
$output = 'output_example'; // string | Rectangular output for BI tools (Tableau, Excel, Sheets, ELT). Omit for the default nested JSON. 'flat' returns the same metadata plus 'columns' and 'rows'; 'csv' returns those rows as text/csv. Errors are always returned as JSON.
$prompt_type = 'prompt_type_example'; // string | One prompt type or a comma-separated list: informational, navigational, commercial, transactional
$brand_kind = 'brand_kind_example'; // string | Filter by brand kind: brand (own brand/products), brand_other (competitors/other brands), non_brand (generic, no brand named). For fair 1:1 brand-vs-competitor comparisons (visibility, share of voice), use non_brand: brand-focused prompts skew results toward the brand they name. The in-app Overview page applies non_brand by default.
$range = 56; // int | Number of days to look back (alternative to from/to)

try {
    $apiInstance->listSources($project_id, $page, $per_page, $model, $collection_id, $country_code, $language_code, $prompt, $from, $to, $source_type, $mention_filter, $competitors, $output, $prompt_type, $brand_kind, $range);
